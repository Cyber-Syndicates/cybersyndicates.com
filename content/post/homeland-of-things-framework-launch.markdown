## Background
Vulnerabilities, threats, and subsequent risks are inherent with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which typically reside at the meeting place of critical infrastructure and cyberspace. We present the HoT Framework to promote best practices for all Federal and State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) governments, non-government organizations (NGOs), and the private sector to use as a foundation for the reconnaissance, interrogation, and hardening of IoT nodes that are characterized as existing within both critical and non-critical infrastructure throughout the physical network layer, logical network layer, and cyber-persona layer of cyberspace terrain. In addition, we propose solutions for, public awareness of, and information sharing regarding the vulnerabilities, threats, risks, mitigations, and countermeasures associated with the IoT. The HoT Framework serves to assist Federal and SLTT governments, NGOs, and the private sector in thwarting attacks against their IoT devices and preventing their IoT devices from being used as an attack platform. For the framework to be effective, we need direct support from the DHS, DoD, DOJ, and other Federal agencies. We will also need to establish partnerships with SLTT, NGO, and the private sector (academia and industry) to further enrich and develop the framework using real-world data. We will continue to enrich the framework with technical modules and videos that demonstrate how to conduct the steps within the framework.
