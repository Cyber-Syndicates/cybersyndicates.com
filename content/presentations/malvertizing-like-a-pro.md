## A Jump Into The Newest Attack Vector



Recently at @BSidesAugusta I had the privilege to present my talk on Malvertizing and how I set out to verify my hypothesis. After some heavy research, time gathering as much possible information I decided it was time to take matters into my hands and bring some light to this major issue. Really trying to get people to talk about something that you rarely hear about in the info sec community. So enjoy my speech or just check out the slide deck.

Mostly I hope you share this content or give me some feedback, I would love to hear what you have to say!
